Countries spend hundreds of millions on their bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) alone , vying for the chance to bring the windfall to their doorstep. However, the claim to economic fame as a result of the Olympics has come under question in recent years, with continued cost overruns inflating costs and the IOC taking increasing cuts from the host countries’ revenue. In combination with the travel restrictions and limitations on large group gatherings in the post-COVID-19 world, the financial future of the Olympic Games is uncertain – countries must be cautious, should they bid to host the Olympics, to be aware of the financial implications of such a decision. This study attempts to provide further granularity to such an understanding by comparing the economic impacts of hosting the Olympics for a given country at the regional level. We examine the tourism, GDP, income and unemployment data at the regional level for three different case study countries – Canada for Vancouver 2010, the United Kingdom for London 2012, and Brazil for Rio 2016 – leading up to and following an Olympics hosting. Through tourism, we aim to be able to break down a commonly cited source of revenue from the Olympics; GDP provides insight into the total economic growth of the event; unemployment, similar to tourism, tracks one of the claimed long-term effects of the Olympics. With this analysis, we hope to provide insight into the regional breakdown of the economic effects, or lack thereof, of hosting an Olympics and how in aggregate they contribute to the more widely known national economic impacts of the games.

The raw data is an xlsx file with 13 tables about UK GDP. We make use of table 5 which is UK’s Gross domestic product at current market prices. Reference: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/datasets/regionalgrossdomesticproductallnutslevelregions Manipulation: We use excel to extract only the regional GDP over years and output the new data table as a csv file with name uk_gdp.csv. london_earnings_by_borough.csv Description: This dataset is from the Datathon materials and details information on the pay of workers in various regions of the UK from 2002 to 2019. The dataset has 6 variables, of which we make use of year, area, and pay variables. Year details the year of the datapoint’s collection. Area details the area in the UK of the worker for whom the datapoint was collected. Pay details the pay in hours or weekly. Manipulation: We convert hourly pay to weekly pay by dropping any rows that have either no pay_type or no pay, and then multiplied all hourly pay by 40 to get weekly pay under the assumption of a 40 hour work week. UK_international-visits.csv Description: This dataset, also from the provided Datathon materials, details the activity of various groups of international visitors to regions of the UK from the years 2002 to 2019. The dataset has 11 variables, and we make use of the year, quarter, area, visits, spend, and nights variables among these. Year details the year of the visit, and quarter details its quarter. Manipulation: We can combine these two variables together to produce a year + quarter variable with entries of the form 2XXXQY (e.g. 2015Q3 would be quarter 3 of 2015). Area details the region the visitors visited. Visits, spend, and nights are the number of visits made by the group samples, the amount spent by the group sampled (in millions of £), and the total number of nights spent in the area detailed by the group sampled respectively. 2.2 Data for Analysis of Canada canada_gdp.csv Description: This dataset is one of our supplementary datasets found on Statistics Canada, which covers Canada regional GDP from 2000 to 2019. Reference: Table 36-10-0402-01 Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by industry, provinces and territories (x 1,000,000) DOI: https://doi.org/10.25318/3610040201-eng Website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3610040201 Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate the 5 regions in Canada. We also change the unit of GDP from millions to trillions for better visualization. For regional GDP calculation, we simply add the GDP of all provinces/territories within one larger region. For regional GDP growth rate calculation, we use the formula: (value of this year - value of last year)/value of last year, and keep two decimals for the percentage of growth rate. For increasing rate calculation by using other tables in section 4.1 to 4.3, we use the same formula. Note: Raw data has value of GDP in Chained (2012) Dollars in Millions. canada_in_un.csv Description: This dataset is one of our supplementary datasets found on Statistics Canada, which covers Canada regional household income per capita and unemployment rate. Reference: Table 36-10-0229-01 Long-run provincial and territorial data DOI: https://doi.org/10.25318/3610022901-eng website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3610022901 Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate the 5 regions in Canada. We drop the missing values in this dataset. Also, we take mean to calculate the regional average household income per capita and unemployment rate. Note: The value of Household Income Per Capita is in Dollars and the value of Unemployment Rate is in Percent. ca_vis.csv Description: This dataset is one of our supplementary datasets found on Statistics Canada, which covers the number of international visitors entering different regions of Canada from 2000 to 2019. Reference: Table 24-10-0005-01 International travellers entering or returning to Canada, by province of entry, seasonally adjusted DOI: https://doi.org/10.25318/2410000501-eng website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=2410000501 Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate the 5 regions in Canada. We change the unit of number of visitors to millions. Also, we drop the missing values in this dataset. For calculation of regional number of tourists, we simply add up numbers of tourists entering different provinces/territories within one region. Vancouver_employment_by_industry.csv Description: This data is from Datathon Materials and has 3 variables: year, industry code, and value. This dataset covers the number of people employed in various industries in British Columbia from 1987 through 2019. Manipulation: Although the data covers various sub-industries within larger sectors, we used data from the larger industries: Agriculture, Forestry/fishing/mining/oil/gas, Utilities, Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Warehousing, Finance/Insurance/Real Estate/Leasing, Professional/Scientific/Technical Services, Business/Building/Other Support Services, Educational Services, Health Care/Social Assistance, Information/Culture/Recreation, Accommodation/Food Services, Other Services, Public Administration; in addition, we use data for the larger categories: Goods-Producing Sector, Services-Producing Sector, and Total. The industry names are converted from the numerical codes to the names provided in an Excel sheet from Statistics Canada: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028703. We graph each of these variables by year. We graph yearly changes in employment: we use the total employment (industry_code = ‘0’) and graph the employment rate of change from 1988-2019: (employment in year i - employment in year i-1) / (employment in year i ). Vancouver_turism_indicators.csv Description: This data is from the Dataton Materials and tracks economic variables in the tourism industry from 2000 through 2015. We use the following variables: real_GDP, employment, revenue, wages_and_salaries, consumption_taxes, employment_vcm, employment_vi, employment_to, employment_nbc, employment_nbr, employment_ccc. Manipulation: We adjust revenue, wages, salaries, and consumption taxes for inflation by multiplying these quantities by the implicit_price_index/100 for each year. We graph the rate of change of each of the employment variables by year and the values of the aggregate economic variables. Specifically, we graph all regions (vcm, vi, to, nbc, nbr, ccc) together and all aggregate variables (real_GDP, employment, revenue, wages_and_salaries, consumption_taxes) together. Vancouver_visits.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials. It covers Vancouver overnight visitors from 1994 to 2018. It has 3 variables: year, month and value. Manipulation: We graph the number of monthly tourists in Vancouver from 2000 through 2018. Additionally, we sum monthly tourists for entire years, graph yearly tourists and graph annual changes in tourism. 2.3 Data for Analysis of Brazil brazil_gdp.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 4 variables: state, region, year, value. The variable region is a smaller region in state. It covers Brazil GDP from year 2002 to 2017. Manipulation: Since the raw data is on a state-level of Brazil GDP over years, we add an additional variable larger_region to indicate which of the 5 regions a row belongs to. The regional division criteria are in section 5. The raw data has GDP values in thousands of Reals. For better visualization, we modify the unit to trillions of Reals. For regional GDP calculation, we simply add the GDP value of all states within one larger region to get the result. For regional GDP growth rate calculation, we use the formula: (value of this year - value of last year)/value of last year and keep two decimals for the percentage of growth rate. For increasing rate calculation by using other tables in section 5, we use the same formula. brazil_monthly_income.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 5 variables: year, quarter, job_type, state, value. It covers Brazil monthly income from year 2012 to 2020. Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate Brazil’s 5 regions. This data has missing values, we choose to drop all missing values. Also, for the ridgeline plot and histograms in section 5.2, we remove higher outliers by using the criteria: \\(Q_3 + (1.5\\times \\text{IQR})\\), where \\(Q_3\\) is the upper quartile and IQR is the Interquatile Range. Points above the criteria are defined to be higher outliers. For each region’s average monthly income, we take the mean of all data points within one region. brazil_unemployment.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 5 variables: year, quarter, category, state, value. It covers Brazil unemployment from year 2012 to 2019. Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate Brazil’s 5 regions. For unemployment rate calculation, we first calculate the total workforce. Then use the formula: Unemployment Rate = Number of Unemployment/Workforce, where Workforce = Number of Unemployment + Number of Employment. Then we take the mean to get the average yearly unemployment rate. brazil_tourism_jobs.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 6 variables: year, month, region, state, job_type, jobs. It covers Brazil tourism jobs from year 2006 to 2018. Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate Brazil’s 5 regions. To calculate the average number of tourism jobs for each region and each year, we first calculate the number of total tourism jobs for each region in each month. Then we calculate the yearly average by taking the mean of 12 months within 1 year. We also change the unit of number of jobs in thousands for better visualization. "],
["uk-2012-london-olympics.html", "Chapter 3 UK - 2012 London Olympics 3.1 UK GDP 3.2 UK Weekly Pay 3.3 UK International Tourism 3.4 UK Conclusion", " Chapter 3 UK - 2012 London Olympics Analysis of Regional Economic Impacts of Hosting Olympics on the United Kingdom Introduction In this part of our report, we discuss the impact of the 2012 London Olympics on the UK as a whole, as well as its constituent subregions. We focus on UK GDP, weekly pay and international tourism. The 2012 Olympic Games took place at London. London was awarded to host the games in 2005. Region Description We divide the UK into 12 regions, with London, which hosted the Olympics, being one of them. The regions consist of the normal division of England as well as separate regions for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. These regions are: 1. South West 2. Wales 3. East 4. North East 5. Northern Ireland 6. North West 7. West Midlands 8. East Midlands 9. South East 10. Scotland 11. London 12. Yorkshire and The Humber Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_England 3.1 UK GDP In order to understand the economic impact of the Olympics on the UK and its subregions, we first detail its total effect on the GDP of the UK in totality by graphing its changes over the time period from 1998 to 2018. This figure depicts the general growth of the nationwide GDP, with the exception of a brief drop during the period of the 2008 Great Recession. Through the image, we observe a consistent upwards trend from the beginning of the time series, with no particular growth rate change either in the time period following final selection or the Olympic Games. We further break down the GDP growth into the aforementioned 12 regions and analyze GDP growth by region to assess its potential effects on a smaller scale. UK Regional GDP One of the first aspects to note is the dominance of the South East and London regions in GDP size. The other regions are relatively comparable both in total GDP and growth rate, while the two regions mentioned above are both larger and exhibit more rapid growth in the time period pictured. In particular, the graph preliminarily seems to suggest that London received the bulk of the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics as the largest GDP region and its rapid growth observed during the preparation season and continuing afterward. The following table breaks displays the growth rates of each region in more detail, with darker colors representing more rapid growth. Most notably, London boasted a high growth rate during the intermediate years between selection and the games, while the other regions have far lower maximum growth rates. UK Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 1999 to 2018 Together, the plots suggest that though there may be a slight difference in regional impact and its affect on GDP, the growth rates are similar enough across all parties that we are unable to statistically verify the significance of this difference. 3.2 UK Weekly Pay To more deeply understand whether or not the Olympics had any impact on the UK, we examine the changes in the weekly pay of workers in each of our regions of interest over time. We begin this analysis by creating a boxplot for the pay of workers in all of the UK over the years 2002 to 2019. This boxplot will show us general trends in pay as well as whether there are any outliers we need to account for. This boxplots above lead to two important conclusion: 1) There are no special outliers in pay we have to account for. 2) The median weekly pay of workers seems to grow only slightly over time, leading to an initial conclusion that the 2012 olympics may not have had a significant effect. We can further analyze this second conclusion by viewing the distribution of pay over time using a Joyplot. Density Estimation on Weekly Pay Although this plot does admit some changes in the distribution of weekly pay from 2002 to 2019, it reinforces the conclusion that the 2012 Olympic Games were not the cause of this change. Instead, we conclude through inspection that this shift begins around 2004 and and is nearly complete by 2008. All the years after 2008 appear to have nearly identical distributions, including 2012 and beyond. The above conclusion can be analyzed on the regional level by plotting similar Joyplots of distribution of pay for each of our regions of interest. Through inspection, we conclude that these plots as well support the conclusion that the 2012 Olympics had no impact on the distribution of pay in any region. In fact, the near uniformity of the distributions calls into question whether any meaningful regional distinctions among worker pay are to be had in the UK. From these regional plots, we make three observations: 1. With the sole exception of London, each of the distributions is nearly uni-modal with peaks ranging from 300 to 600 £. That London is the exception in this case provides further evidence that the regional impact of the Olympics on London may be different than other regions. 2. Regardless of the region, we see that while changes do occur in the distribution over time, those changes are well under way before the 2012 Olympics. This leads to the conclusion that the Olympics did not have a large impact on regional pay distribution. 3. With reference to observation 1, the near uniformity of many of the distributions across regions suggests a further conclusion that meaningful regional distinctions in worker pay may not be had, with the exception of London. Regional Average Weekly Pay After analyzing regional densities for weekly pay. We calculate the regional average weekly pay to visualize the trend before and after the Olympic year 2012. The multiple time series plot shows that there is no significant increase in average weekly pay from 2012 to 2014 for all the regions. London seems to increase its average weekly pay starting from 2014. The trends for the 12 regions follow a similar increasing pattern from 2002 to 2019, but the Olympic year does not bring any significant increase in weekly pay for London. The above plot allows us to conclude by inspection that with the possible exception of London, no meaningful regional impact was had by the Olympics on Average Weekly Pay. We are able to observe that London’s average weekly pay plot appears to follow a flat if not downward trend leading up to and soon after the Olympics and that in 2014 this trend is reversed leading to increased growth. However, we were not able to perform statistical tests to analyze whether this change can be attributed to the Olympics. Again we note the uniformity of the trends in Average Weekly Pay shown by most other regions, reinforcing our preliminary conclusion that regional differences are not very large. 3.3 UK International Tourism To further examine our theory that no meaningful impact was had by the London 2012 Olympics on the regional level, we can explore another metric of regional and country success: tourism. An initial analysis can be obtained by plotting the total number of tourists. This plot does show a high degree of variance in the number of tourists over time, especially when we consider seasonality. However, if inspected more closely, it supports that the 2012 Olympics is responsible for the uptick in visitation that occurred post 2008. We again analyze this conclusion on a regional level, both through the number of visits to each of the regions as well as through data on the spending and number of nights stayed in each region. The red line in the above plots indicates the London 2012 Olympics. Although we do not see the same constancy as in the regional pay distribution plots, we find that changes after the London 2012 Olympics have already been in progress across all three of these metrics. Because it is difficult to compare regions, especially those with lower metrics, in the above plots, we show individual plots on a per-region level below. These plots allow for further clarity on the regional breakdown of these tourism indicators. Of note, we do see meaningful regional distinctions among these factors. This is in contrast to the regional breakdown of economic data, which showed almost no distinction among regions. This conclusion makes sense, as certain parts of the UK are more attractive tourist destinations than other parts. Nonetheless, irregardless of which region we explore, none of them seem to show are large change in behavior directly following or as a result of the 2012 Olympics. 3.4 UK Conclusion From the above observational analysis, we are able to conclude that the Olympics does not have a large impact on the national or regional economic and tourism indicators for the United Kingdom. When broken down by region, we found that the economic data showed a large degree of uniformity, leading to a suggestion that meaningful economic differences cannot be found across regions. The tourism data did show more heterogeneity when broken down by region, however in all indicators measured we did not find that the Olympics produced significant changes for any individual region.

In addition, we also focus on Vancouver tourism over years to better understand the impacts on tourism by the Olympics. The 2010 Winter Olympic Games took place at Vancouver. Vancouver was awarded to host the games in 2003. Region Description We divided Canada to 5 regions, where Vancouver is in the West Coast region. 1. The Atlantic Provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 2. Central Canada: Quebec, Ontario 3. The Prairie Provinces: Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan 4. The West Coast: British Columbia 5. The Northern Territories: Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon Territories Reference: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/discover-canada/read-online/canadas-regions.html 4.1 Canada GDP The first potential economic outcome of the Olympics that we consider is GDP growth. We make a multiple time series plot to visualize the regional GDP in Canada. The plot shows that there is a slight decreasing for Central Canada and the Prairie provinces between 2008 and 2009, following by a slight increasing pattern after 2009. For the other three regions, the lines of GDP stay quite stable. The 2010 Olympics does not impact regional GDP growth significantly. GDP on the West Coast (British Columbia) appears to improve after 2010 (when the Olympics were held), but as indicated in the table below, the improvement did not outpace that of other regions after the Olympics. Canada Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 2001 to 2019 The table shows that the highest GDP growth rate appears at the Northern territories which is 13.87% in 2001, whereas the lowest GDP growth rate appears at the Northern territories which is -5.85% in 2009. Also, in 2009, all 5 regions have negative GDP growth rates, but in 2010, all 5 regions have positive GDP growth rates. However, the West Coast does not show a higher GDP growth rate than other 4 regions. The Olympics may have increased GDP growth for Canada, but there is no significant regional difference in GDP growth after the Olympics. 4.2 Canada Household Income Per Capita We next consider household income per capita. We also make a regional time series plot first. Regional Average Household Income Per Capita The plot shows that household income per capita in the West Coast increases fast between 2006 and 2007. It decreases from 2008 to 2010, then starts to increase after 2010. The Prairie provinces follows a same pattern as the West Coast. Also, the Northern territories increases fast between 2012 and 2013. After 2013, household income per capita in the Northern territories exceeds that in the Prairie provinces. Similar to our observation about GDP, although the West Coast grows after the Olympics, its growth rate did not exceed that of the rest of Canada. To make our conclusion more precise, we calculate the household income per capita increasing rate as shown in the following table. Canada Regional Household Income Per Capita Increasing Rate from 2001 to 2016 The table shows that the highest household income per capita growth rate appears at the Northern territories which is 23.99% in 2013, whereas the lowest household income per capita growth rate appears at the Prairie provinces which is -2.25% in 2010. Also, the increasing rates increase for all 5 regions in 2011 comparing to 2010. However, the West Coast does not show a higher growth rate than other 4 regions. Similar to our analysis on GDP, the Olympics may have increased household income per capita growth for Canada, but there is no significant regional difference in GDP growth after the Olympics. 4.3 Canada Unemployment Rate Next, we consider possible gains in employment resulting from the Olympic games by visualizating the overall unemployment rate in Canada over years. This helps us to better understand the national unemployment rate pattern. From the stacked bar chart, we find that the lowest unemployment rate appears in 2007 whereas the highest rate appears in the Olympic year 2010. Unemployment appears to increase slight from 20018 to 2010 and remains steady (but not decrease) after the Olympics. Unemployment Rate by Regions To better understand the impact of the Olympics, we plot unemployment over time in different to compare how unemployment changed in British Columbia (where the Olympics were held) versus other regions. From 2004 to 2006, the unemployment rate decreases for all 5 regions, but increases from 2008 to 2009. After 2010, the West Coast (British Columbia) has a decreasing pattern in unemployment but not one that was significantly different from the decrease in other regions. This trend can also be observed in the below table, in which the West Coast does not appear to outperform other regions in employment gains after 2010. Canada Regional Unemployment Rate Increasing Rate from 2001 to 2016 The table shows that the highest unemployment rate increasing rate appears at the West Coast which is 67.39% in 2009, whereas the lowest one appears at the Northern territories which is -23.67% in 2002. Also, the increasing rates of unemployment rate decreases in 2011 comparing to 2010 for the regions except the West Coast. The Olympic games did not result in a significant decrease in unemployment rate for the West coast. 4.4 Canada Tourism The last part for our analysis is on Canada tourism over years. We first plot the overall number of international visitors in Canada to get a better understanding of the national trend. The national-level time series of number of international visitors in Canada shows a significant decreasing pattern from 2000 to 2010. Then the number of visitors increases slowly after 2010. The Olympics may have increased Canada’s international tourism, but not significantly. Then we want to focous on the regional international tourism. The plot shows the number of international visitors entering each of the 5 regions. From this plot, we find that the Northern territories, the Prairie provinces and the Atlantic provinces all have stable patterns. Also, the number of visitors is low over years for each of the 3 regions. The central Canada follows the same pattern as the national international visitors as shown in the time series plot before. The line of the West Coast is also relatively stable, but there is a spike in 2010. It is much possible that the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver causes the spike. However, the spike only lasts for a very short time. From the analysis on Canada tourism, it does not appear that British Columbia (West Canada) benefited substantially from hosting the Olympic games: although there was a spike in tourism in early 2010 (likely due to the Olympics), international tourism held steady after 2010 with slight increases (but not visibly different from those in other regions). Since the Prairie provinces, the Northern territories and the Atlantic provinces has low and stable patterns over time, these 3 regions’ effects on tourism are neglectable. We want to look at tourism and economic data within British Columbia and Vancouver to better understand the tourism impact of the Olympics. 4.5 Targeting Tourism in Vancouver We first visualize the monthly tourists in Vancouver. Note: the 2010 Olympics occur around month 120. Since this data is highly cyclical, we graph the year-over-year change in tourism (starting from January 2001) so that changes are measured between corresponding points in the cycle: We notice a spike slightly after the month 100, which corresponds to the 2010 Olympics, and a dip slightly after, which corresponds to the year after the Olympics. However, the year-over-year changes do not appear to have an upward trend or spike after the Olympics. We also graph the total number of tourists for each year and the year-over-year change: Total annual tourism appears to have an upward trend. However, trends in tourism growth do not appear to change over time. Growth appears to stay in the positive ranges it was at during previous periods of positive growth—we furthermore note that past declines at tourism occurred during recessions (early 2000s and 2008-2009). There is no evidence that the increases in tourism during the recovery (2010 onwards) are any greater than increases in previous periods of economic growth. We now examine economic variables for Vancouver from 2000-2015: All graphs appear to show steady growth except during recessions (early 2000s or 2008-2009). We now examine economic trends by region and industry. Below is a plot of changes in tourism employment for different regions of British Columbia: There does not appear to be a substantial deviation in trends after the Olympics. While tourism employment in Cariboo, Thompson Okanagan, and Northern British Columbia appear to increase in 2013 more than in other regions, employment also falls faster in the subsequent year, suggesting that there was not a differential effect on employment in different regions from the Olympics. We plot employment in different sectors within British Columbia over time: We consider changes in employment in various industries: the faster increase in the tourism sector does not appear to deviate substantially from the also faster increases in employment in the good-producing and services sectors. We finally compare changes in tourism to changes in economic variables (specific in the tourism sector): The clearest trends appear in the relationship between real GDP (from the tourism sector) and annual tourism and the relationship between revenue and tourism. Running linear regressions on the relationships, we get the following R2 values (rounded in four decimals): R^2 for real_GDP: 0.5529 R^2 for employment: 0.0019 R^2 for revenue: 0.6149 R^2 for wages_and_salaries: 0.2452 R^2 for consumption_taxes: 0.0356 The coefficients are only significant for the relationships between real_GDP/tourism and revenue/tourism. Thus, tourism does not appear to have a significant impact on employment, salaries, or taxes, even within the tourism sector. 4.6 Canada Conclusion On a national level, economic outcomes—specifically GDP, household income, and employment—show growth after the 2010 Olympic games. However, this growth appears to be uniform across regions in Canada. In terms of international tourism, the decline in tourism to Central Canada and the West Coast appears to halt after the 2010 Olympics. However, there is no strong evidence that post-2010 gains in tourism in the West Coast (where the Olympics were held) is greater than that in other regions. Within Vancouver, there is some evidence of an increase in tourism following the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. However, there is not strong evidence that these sustained increases in tourism contributed to substantial economic benefits for Vancouver, British Columbia, or Canada. In fact, tourism increases contributed to tourism GDP and revenue but did not appear to affect any other other economic variables. In conclusion, we find that the Olympics did not have a significantly positive impact on Canada, British Columbia, or Vancouver; even though there were some local gains in tourism within Vancouver, we do not find that the economic outcomes of this tourism were any better than those in the rest of British Columbia or Canada.

The 2016 Olympic Games took place at Rio de Janeiro. Rio was awarded to host the games in 2009.

North region: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins. 2. Northeast region: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. 3. Midwest region: Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Distrito Federal (Federal District). 4. Southeast region: Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. 5. South region: Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Brazil 5.1 Brazil GDP Brazil Regional GDP First, we want to visualize the regional GDP of Brazil, so we make a multiple time series plot. Also, we add two vertical lines to mark the year of final selection (2009) and the year of the Olympics (2016). From this plot, we find that from year 2002 to 2017, South East region always has a higher GDP than other 4 regions. After year 2019, the GDP for all of the 5 regions seem to increase faster than before, especially the South East region. Since 2009 is the year when Rio was awarded to host the 2016 Olympics, we come up with a hypothesis that the success of the bid for Brazil helps to increase the GDP growth rate, especially for the South East. In other words, the final selection brings different regional GDP growth impact on Brazil. However, the plot does not show a higher increasing rate for all of the 5 regions after the Olympic year 2016. Also, since our raw data does not provide the statistics after year 2017, our analysis may have some limitation to analyze the regional GDP impact after year 2016. Also, the plot shows that the GDP growth rate of South East region decreases from 2014 to 2016. Before we get to our conclusion, we want to get a closer look at regional GDP growth rate. Brazil Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 2003 to 2017 From this table, we find that the highest GDP growth rate appears at year 2010 in North region, which is 24.60%, whereas the lowest GDP growth rate appears at year 2015 in South East region, which is 2.02%. Also, the regional GDP increase rate peaked at 2010 for almost all regions. Year 2010 is the year after the final selection of Olympics, whereas year 2015 is the year before the Olympic games. The table also shows that in year 2016, the GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions has no significant changes compared to 2015. The highest increase in GDP growth rate appears at Mid West region in the Olympic year, but the increasing percent is \\(9.2\\%-6.84\\% = 2.36\\%\\), which is small. The changes of growth rate in year 2017 are also not significant for the 5 regions. Moreover, we find that before year 2019, the GDP growth rate for all 5 regions stays around 10+ percent, but the previous multiple time series plot shows that South East region may have a higher GDP growth rate than the other 4 regions after 2009. If we have an assumption that “before 2009, all of the 5 regions in Brazil have the same GDP growth rate”, we can then test whether the 5 regions still have the same GDP growth rate after 2009. The reason why we want to do this test is to check if the success of Olympic bid will bring a more significant GDP growth for South East region. Therefore, we want to first test our assumption by using a One-Way ANOVA test using the existing data from 2003 to 2009. First ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2003 to 2009: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2003 to 2009 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Description: This test is for checking whether our initial assumption holds, where the assumption is “Before the final selection year, the 5 regions in Brazil have the same GDP growth rate”. Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00143 0.0003574 0.212 0.93 ## Residuals 30 0.05062 0.0016873 Conclusion: From the summary of test table, we find that the p-value is 0.93, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we cannot say the mean of GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions have significant difference. Therefore, our initial assumption holds, then we can continue to test whether there are significant differences in the means of GDP growth rate for the 5 regions after 2009. In the next test, we still use the One-Way ANOVA test, but we use the existing data from 2010 to 2017. Second ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2010 to 2017: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2010 to 2017 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Description: Based on the assumption from the first ANOVA test, we want to conduct a second test to check whether the means of GDP growth rate for the 5 regions still remain the same from 2010 to 2017. If the test result shows a significant difference in the means, we can conclude that the succuss of 2016 Olympic bid shows a significant GDP growth on regional levels. Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00276 0.0006893 0.292 0.881 ## Residuals 35 0.08270 0.0023629 Conclusion: From the summary table, we find that the p-value is 0.881, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, from 2010 to 2017, we cannot say the GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions has a significant difference. For both tests, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the year 2009 does not bring a different regional GDP growth rate impact on Brazil. This conclusion is not consistent with our initial hypothesis from the multiple time series plot. In conclusion, for Brazil regional GDP analysis, the data does not show that the Olympic games results in any significant difference in GDP growth across the regions in Brazil. 5.2 Brazil Monthly Income Monthly Income Distribution Before we analyze the regional average monthly income, we want to first visualize the distribution of monthly income for the entire country from 2012 to 2020. This will help us to get a better understanding of the overall distribution of Brazil monthly income over years. We first make a multiple boxplot over years to better visualize the robust statistics: medians, quartiles and outliers. From the boxplots we find that the median of national monthly income shows an increasing pattern from 2012 to 2020. However, the plot does not show any significant increase in the median of monthly income after the Olympic year 2016 on national level. The Interquartile Range also increases from 2012 to 2020. Then we want to visualize the density distribution for the national monthly income, but by the boxplots, there are higher outliers for each year. If we keep those outliers, it will be hard to visualize the density plot, so we remove those higher outliers for better visualization. Note: Higher Outlier definition: points above \\(Q_3 + (1.5\\times \\text{IQR})\\), where \\(Q_3\\) is the upper quartile and IQR is the Interquatile Range. The ridgeline plot helps us to better understand the density estimation. From 2012 to 2020, the peak of density curves increases from 1000 to 1500 approximately. Also, the tail of the density curves becomes much heavier from 2012 to 2020. These observations shows that the monthly income has an increasing pattern over years. However, between 2015 and 2017, the density curves do not show a more significant increasing pattern. Regional Monthly Income Distribution in the Olympics Year 2016 Next, we want to focus on the regional level. We pick data of the Olympic year 2016 and plot a set of histograms grouped by regions. We want to first check whether there are any significant difference in the distributions of regional monthly income. If hosting the Olympics may result in different regional impact, there may be difference in the regional distribution of monthly income in 2016. In this plot, we also remove the outliers for better visualization. The histograms shows all of the 5 regions have most density in monthly income less than 2000 but greater than 1000. Also, South East region does not show a distribution of higher monthly income than other regions in year 2016. Regional Average Monthly Income Now we move to visualize the regional average monthly income. Here we keep the outliers because we are calculating the regional average for each year. The plot shows an overall increasing pattern in monthly income for all of the 5 regions, where the income of Mid West region increases most fast from 2017 to 2018, but decreases from 2019 to 2020. The plot does not show a more significant increasing after 2016 than before. Also the patterns for all of the 5 regions do not appear to have significant difference. Regional Monthly Income Increasing Rate from 2013 to 2020 From the income increasing rate table, we find that the highest rate (11.55%) takes place at Mid West region in 2018, whereas the lowest one (-3.22%) takes place at Mid West region in 2020. For South East Region, the increasing rate in 2016 is lower than that in 2015. Together with the multiple time series plot, we find that the regional monthly income increases after the Olympic year, but the increasing rates do not become much more significant comparing with previous ones before 2016. Relationship between Brazil GDP and Monthly Income Then we create an animated scatter plot to visualize the relationship between GDP and month income by regions over years. From this plot, we find that the points are moving up and right. Each of these point represents a state in Brazil and the color shows its region. One state in Mid West region has the highest GDP and monthly income over years. Also, two states in South East region have higher GDP than the majority of states. 5.3 Brazil Unemployment Rate Another way we can analyze the potential impact of the Olympic Games on Brazil is through analyzing the unemployment rate over time. First we make a stacked bar chart to visualization the national unemployment rate from 2012 to 2019. The stacked bar chart shows that year 2017 has the highest unemployment rate, whereas year 2014 has the lowest unemployment rate. Also, the unemployment rate keeps increasing from 2015 to 2017. The above plot confirms our conclusion that the 2016 Rio Olympics did not appreciably benefit Brazil as measured through the unemployment rate. In fact, during the years that follow the Olympics the unemployment rate seems to increase, not decrease, which suggest a possible negative effect that could be the subject of future exploration. Unemployment Rate by Regions Now let’s move to the regional level. We want to check whether the 5 regions follow a same pattern as the national unemployment rate. From 2012 to 2014, the unemployment rate decreases for the 5 regions. However, during the period between 2014 and 2017, the unemployment rate increases for the 5 regions. The unemployment rate starts to decrease after 2017. The regions follow the same pattern as the national pattern, except Mid West region has an increasing unemployment rate from 2018 to 2019. For more precise conclusion, we also calculate the exact regional unemployment rate increasing rate. Unemployment Rate Increasing Rate by Regions from 2013 to 2019 Since 2014, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing for all of the 5 regions until 2017. The highest increasing rate appears at year 2016 which is the Olympics year for all of the 5 regions. The unemployment rate drops starting from 2018. Therefore, the 2016 Rio Olympic games did not benefit Brazil’s unemployment rate. There are no significant differences in regional unemployment patterns observed as well. 5.4 Brazil Tourism Now we want to analyze Brazil tourism to check whether the Olympics benifits the tourism, especially for the South East region. From the multiple time series plot, we find that from 2006 to 2018, South East region alwasys has a much higher number of tourism jobs than the other regions. After 2009, the final selection year, all of the 5 regions seems to increase faster than before in the number of tourism jobs. However, from 2015 to 2017, South East region seems to decreases slightly. This shows that the Olympics does not necessarily increase the number of tourism jobs for South East region. The decreasing in number of tourism jobs in South East region complies with the pattern of Brazil unemployment rate. 5.5 Brazil Conclusion The above analysis allowed us to view the impact of the Olympics on Brazil and its constituent regions through an economic and tourism lens. We concluded through Anova tests that there are no statistically significant distinctions between the growth rates of each region before and after the Olympics. We also observe that although changes do occur in income distribution, these do not seem to be attributable to the Olympics. A similar conclusion is reached through analysis of unemployment rate – in fact this data suggests a possible negative impact of the hosting of the Olympics! Finally, analysis of tourism jobs shows almost no changes whatsoever as a result of the Olympics. All of these analyses support our conclusion that the Olympics did not have a considerably positive impact on Brazil or its constituent regions. "],
["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In this project, we analyzed both the National and Regional impact of hosting the Olympics on a country’s economic and tourism indicators. We drew conclusions on a country by country basis: The United Kingdom: There was a large amount of economic heterogeneity. While tourism data showed more regional distinction, we did not find that any changes intra-region could be attributed to the Olympics. Brazil: Extensive analysis of indicators for economic and tourism data demonstrated through both observation and statistical measurements that there were no meaningful changes that could be attributed to the Olympics on the regional level. Canada: Although there was growth in tourism within Vancouver following the 2010 Olympics, we did not find any differential effects on economic outcomes across different regions within British Columbia or Canada, suggesting that economic growth after 2010 could not be attributed to the Olympics. In the future, we believe additional work can be done in this direction by collecting and analyzing more indicators and performing additional statistical tests. Specifically, we think one could further explore the breakdown of GDP by industries as well as perform statistical tests that can determine whether the Olympics had a statistically significant impact, as most of our analysis is done by inspection. We hope to see these topics explored in the future. "]
